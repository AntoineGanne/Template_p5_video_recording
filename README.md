# Template for the video recording of a p5 sketch

based on [this article](https://medium.com/@amatewasu/how-to-record-a-canvas-element-d4d0826d3591)  by Alexis Delrieu.


The objective is to record a video of a p5 sketch using the [MediaRecorder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder)


I used it with a parameter firstFrame and lastFrame because I want control over these for looping animations.

I'm not too happy with the result because a black screen appears at the end of the video. If you know how to fix it, please open an issue or contact me. 

Feel free to use my code. 


## How to run it

Simply open index.html

Recording parameters are a the start of sketch.js
